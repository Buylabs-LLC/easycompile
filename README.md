*An easy JavaScript encryption/compiler tool created by [@FAXES](https://github.com/FAXES) & [@PlutoTheDev](https://github.com/braxtongpoll).*

At times file security in your live product is a must have to keep your assets secure in production. Over the past few months we have been looking to make this a possibility, this is when we found [Bytenode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytenode) on NPM.

EasyCompile uses Bytenode as its form to complile and secure your files through terminal or via website you can host!

### Uses

- Create commercial versions of your application without direct source code
- Create demo/trial versions of your application without direct source code
- Secure your commercial products for distribution

---

### Usage

```js
require("easycompile").changeExtension(".fileextension")
let run = require("./test.fileextension")
run();
```

### Notes
With EasyCompile along with near any Javascript compiler this never will provide full secureity on your applications. However, this is a great gateway to further protecting your application.
